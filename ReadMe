Our solution to this game consists of a naive solver finds partial solutions in polynomial time, an SAT reduction,
and a combination of the two.
Light-up.pdf is the document we wrote(in Hebrew) about the game and our solution:
* The rules 
* How we created puzzles with different parameters and of various sizes 
* The different solution aproches 
* Runtime comparisons
